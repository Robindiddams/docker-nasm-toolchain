# Docker Nasm Toolchain

*disclaimer* I dont know what the word toolchain means so hit me with a PR if you got problem

## What?

A docker container with all (3 of) the tools for writing in the netwide assembler.

## Why?

Say you want to write some NASM code but you have a mac (or something else?), all you really need is three commands so a whole VM for this seems silly. Enter this thing, and *BOOM!* compile, link, execute, debug, everything you need!

## How?
